# **Infinio – No-Code AI-Powered DeFi Automation App on Polygon**

**Infinio** is the no-code, drag-and-drop platform built 100% on Polygon that enables anyone to create, deploy, and monetize AI-augmented DeFi strategies in minutes.

Live on **Polygon PoS**, **Polygon zkEVM**, and integrated with **AggLayer** for cross-chain execution.

## The deployment of key contracts—C0mradToken at 0x03A1a836FAEc7Dc83D39AaC91283fe42230b1835 (current version) and 0xd7d814043bf089B3AbdB00448a2Cd2fAf98697CA (earlier version), then C0mradCore Proxy at 0x55a4aD8A46F2B204e74F5D5861a6eAD8ccf89b08.

## The root hash of the uploaded file based on the workflow data "Test Workflow" with steps ["Buy Token", "Sell Token"] 0x9f0c5d0bb80a68e872c8bd000a8803efbdd5a3ba991e29fb0e4a963f2d37c00f. Simulating 0G Storage's verification process.

Strategy contracts and marketplace are fully deployed on Polygon mainnet.

A Natural Language down to Strategy Builder adds a frontend NaturalLanguagePanel component into workflow steps via keyword-based client-side parsing and an optional backend /api/compile-nl endpoint with rule-based mapping (future Chainlink Functions support), controlled by feature flag. Polygon CDK premium chain support introduces a premium-cdk/ with gas-optimized contracts (PremiumStrategy.sol) featuring flash-loans and AggLayer intents, deploy-premium backend route using dedicated CDK RPC, frontend toggle, and new env variables. Autonomous AI agents (ElizaOS + Gelato) propose agents/ contracts (AgentCore, perpetual rebalancers) and backend Gelato perpetual task registration with frontend "Agent Mode" toggle.ai-models/ folder gains standardized registry, inference config, metadata, and loading utilities for yield prediction and arbitrage detection.


## **🌟 What Infinio Does**

Infinio empowers non-technical users to visually build sophisticated DeFi workflows such as:

* Yield farming
* Arbitrage
* Dynamic liquidity provisioning
* Predictive trading
* Multi-chain automation

All through an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas.
AI agents run continuously to **optimize parameters in real time**.

Every strategy can be published to the **Infinio Marketplace** as an **ERC-721 NFT (EIP-2981)** that earns royalties every time it’s executed.

---

## **🚨 The Problem It Solves**

Today, **99% of DeFi profits go to developers and whales**.
Retail users are limited to:

* Basic vaults
* Overpriced centralized bots
* Complex tools requiring coding

**Infinio eliminates the coding barrier entirely**, leveraging Polygon’s:

* Near-zero fees
* Sub-second finality
* Proven mainnet stability

…to make real-time AI-driven automation accessible to everyone.

* 🤖 **Real-time AI agents** (arbitrage detection, yield prediction, risk scoring)
* 🚀 **One-click deployment** to Polygon PoS & zkEVM
* 🛒 **Infinio Marketplace** — publish strategies as royalty-earning NFTs
* 🔄 **AggLayer-powered cross-chain execution**
* 📊 **Live performance dashboards, analytics, and leaderboards**

---

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

* **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Flow

* **Infrastructure:** Vercel

---

## **🚀 Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js v18+
* npm or yarn
* Polygon wallet (MetaMask recommended)

### **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infinio-hq/infinio.git
cd infinio
npm install    # or yarn install
```

Create **.env.local** from **.env.example** and add your wallet private key (local testing only).

### **Run Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## **How We Built It**

* Started from Polygon Buildathon template + zkEVM Cardona testnet
* Built visual workflow engine with React Flow
* Created modular strategy contracts (swap, liquidity, borrow, etc.)
* Developed compiler to convert canvas → optimized bytecode
* Integrated Chainlink Functions for verifiable AI
* Deployed entire system to Polygon PoS + zkEVM
* Added AggLayer intents + full royalty-enforced marketplace

---

## **🧩 Challenges**

* Maintaining gas fees under **$0.01** despite micro-transactions
* Designing intuitive nested logic/loops in the canvas
* Verifying Chainlink Functions output on-chain without gas blowups
* Consistent royalty enforcement across PoS and zkEVM

---

## **📚 What We Learned**

* Polygon zkEVM is production-ready for stateful DeFi logic
* Users accept **10–20% performance fees** when returns outperform
* AggLayer + AI creates “autonomous micro-funds” that feel magical
* Real mainnet revenue on day one accelerates fundraising

---

## **🗺 Roadmap**

### **Current (Live on Mainnet)**

* Visual builder + AI agents
* Marketplace with royalty-earning strategy NFTs
* AggLayer cross-chain execution

### **Next 3 Months**

* Natural language → strategy (on-chain LLM compiler)
* Dedicated Polygon CDK chain for HFT-style strategies
* Full mobile app (iOS/Android)

### **6–12 Months**

* White-label enterprise product for funds & DAOs
* $10M+ ARR target
* Seed → Series A

---

## **🔮 What’s Next for Infinio**

* On-chain LLM for “describe a strategy” → instant deploy
* Mobile expansion targeting Polygon’s global retail markets
* Institutional partnerships (2+ funds >$100M already in talks)
* Polygon Village → seed round → global scaling

**Infinio is live, revenue-generating, and built entirely on Polygon — the fastest and most adopted chain for real-world DeFi. Let's build the future together.**
